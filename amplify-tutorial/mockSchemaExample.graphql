# They should match the key structure in DynamoDB. Our mock table has two key one is the id of device and another is time record is collected.
# The schema type should match exactly as the table name in DynamoDB to prevent confusion
# The body of the schema is in the format of "[column name]: [data type]!".
# Both column name and type should match exactly in DynamoDB.
